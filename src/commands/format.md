# Auto Format Code

I'll format your code using the project's configured formatter.

First, I'll check what files need formatting and what formatter this project uses. I can see from the project structure and our conversation what tools are appropriate.

I'll format only the files that have been modified to:
- Avoid unnecessary changes
- Keep the formatting focused
- Prevent touching vendor/dependency directories

After formatting, I'll show you what changed.

If formatting fails or no formatter is found:
- I'll explain what I tried
- Show available options
- Let you decide how to proceed

This ensures consistent code style according to your project's standards.
