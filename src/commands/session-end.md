# End Coding Session

I'll summarize this coding session and prepare handoff notes.

Let me analyze what we accomplished by:
1. Looking at what files were created/modified
2. Checking git changes made during the session
3. Summarizing the work completed

```bash
# Find the latest session file
SESSION_FILE=$(ls -t .claude-sessions/session_*.log 2>/dev/null | head -1)

if [ -f "$SESSION_FILE" ]; then
    echo "" >> "$SESSION_FILE"
    echo "=== Session Summary ===" >> "$SESSION_FILE"
    echo "Ended: $(date)" >> "$SESSION_FILE"
    echo "" >> "$SESSION_FILE"
fi

# Check what changed
git diff --stat $(git rev-parse HEAD~1 2>/dev/null || echo HEAD) 2>/dev/null || echo "No git changes"
```

## Session Summary:

### Accomplished:
- I'll list all completed tasks from our conversation
- Files created/modified
- Problems solved

### Pending Items:
- Tasks started but not completed
- Known issues to address
- Next steps recommended

### Handoff Notes:
- Key decisions made
- Important context for next session
- Any blockers or dependencies

This summary helps maintain continuity between coding sessions.
