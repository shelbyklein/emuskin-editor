# Smart Test Runner

I'll run the tests for this project and help with any failures.

First, let me identify and run the appropriate test command based on the project structure and our conversation context.

I'll look for:
- Test configuration files
- Test directories
- Previous test commands used in our conversation
- Package manager configurations

After running the tests, I'll:
1. Parse any failures
2. Show you the specific errors
3. Explain what's wrong
4. Suggest how to fix them

If tests fail due to missing dependencies or configuration issues, I'll help identify and resolve those problems.

If I can't find or run tests:
- I'll explain what I looked for
- Show you what I checked
- Suggest next steps

My goal is to help you understand and fix test failures, not to hide them by changing assertions.
