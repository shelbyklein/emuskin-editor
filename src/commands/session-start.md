# Start Coding Session

I'll begin a documented coding session to track progress and maintain context.

Creating session record with:
- Timestamp: Current date/time
- Git state: Current branch and commit
- Session goals: What we aim to accomplish

```bash
SESSION_DIR=".claude-sessions"
mkdir -p "$SESSION_DIR"
SESSION_FILE="$SESSION_DIR/session_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log"

echo "=== Claude Coding Session ===" > "$SESSION_FILE"
echo "Started: $(date)" >> "$SESSION_FILE"
echo "Branch: $(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo 'no git')" >> "$SESSION_FILE"
echo "Commit: $(git rev-parse --short HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo 'no git')" >> "$SESSION_FILE"
echo "" >> "$SESSION_FILE"
echo "Goals:" >> "$SESSION_FILE"
```

Please tell me:
1. What are we working on today?
2. What specific goals do you want to accomplish?
3. Any context I should know about?

I'll document these goals and track our progress throughout the session.
