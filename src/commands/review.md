# Code Review

I'll review your code for potential issues.

Let me examine the files we've been working on and any recent changes for:

1. **Security Issues**
   - Hardcoded credentials
   - Input validation problems
   - Potential vulnerabilities

2. **Common Bugs**
   - Null/undefined handling
   - Error handling gaps
   - Logic errors

3. **Performance Concerns**
   - Inefficient patterns
   - Memory leaks
   - Unnecessary operations

4. **Code Quality**
   - Dead code
   - Overly complex functions
   - Missing error handling

For each issue I find, I'll:
- Show you exactly where it is
- Explain why it's a problem
- Suggest how to fix it

If I encounter errors during review:
- I'll continue checking other files
- Report what couldn't be analyzed
- Focus on the code I can access

This review focuses on real problems that could affect your application.
