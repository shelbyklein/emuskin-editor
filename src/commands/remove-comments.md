# Remove Obvious Comments

I'll clean up redundant comments while preserving valuable documentation.

First, let me identify files with comments to review:

```bash
# Find files modified recently that likely have comments
if [ -d .git ]; then
    echo "Checking recently modified files for comments..."
    # I'll look at files changed recently in your project
else
    echo "Checking source files in the project..."
    # I'll scan for files that typically contain code
fi
```

I'll analyze each file and remove comments that:
- Simply restate what the code does
- Add no value beyond the code itself
- State the obvious (like "constructor" above a constructor)

I'll preserve comments that:
- Explain WHY something is done
- Document complex business logic
- Contain TODOs, FIXMEs, or HACKs
- Warn about non-obvious behavior
- Provide important context

For each file with obvious comments, I'll:
1. Show you the redundant comments I found
2. Explain why they should be removed
3. Show the cleaner version
4. Apply the changes after your confirmation

This creates cleaner, more maintainable code where every comment has real value.
