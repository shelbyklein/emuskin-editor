# Proposed Next Steps

## Completed Actions

### ✅ Project Initialization
- React project created with Vite and TypeScript
- All core dependencies installed
- Project structure established
- Tailwind CSS configured
- Basic routing implemented

### ✅ Core Components Created
- Canvas component with device-specific rendering
- ImageUploader with drag-and-drop support
- ControlPalette with dynamic button loading
- Layout with responsive navigation
- Editor page with integrated components

## Immediate Next Steps

- Toggle between visual and JSON view
- Validate JSON structure
- Live preview updates

### 4. Export Functionality
- Generate proper JSON file
- Package with uploaded images
- Create ZIP file with JSZip
- Rename to .deltaskin/.gammaskin

## Development Workflow
1. Start with mobile layout first
2. Test on actual mobile devices early
3. Implement features incrementally
4. Regular commits with descriptive messages

## Testing Strategy
- Set up Vitest for unit tests
- Use React Testing Library for components
- Test on multiple mobile devices/sizes
- Focus on touch interaction testing
