## Recommended Next Session Plan

1. **Visual Polish** - Continue improving UI/UX based on recent orientation manager updates:

   - Improve visual hierarchy in the toolbar (group related items)
   - Consider adding visual feedback when hovering over controls in the palette
   
2. **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Quick win for productivity
   - Start with the most common actions (Delete, Arrow keys, Export)
   - Add visual indicators showing keyboard shortcuts in tooltips
   
3. **Toast Notifications** - Better UX improvement  
   - Create reusable toast component
   - Replace alert() dialogs throughout the app
   
4. **Control Alignment Tools** - Precision editing

   - Alignment options (left, right, center, distribute)
   
5. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Review Canvas rendering for optimization opportunities
   - Consider virtualizing long control lists

The visual improvements to OrientationManager were well-received. Consider applying similar visual design patterns to other UI elements for consistency. The grid controls integration into the toolbar also improved organization - look for other opportunities to consolidate related controls.
