# Proposed Next Steps

## Completed Actions

### ✅ Project Initialization
- React project created with Vite and TypeScript
- All core dependencies installed
- Project structure established
- Tailwind CSS configured
- Basic routing implemented

### ✅ Core Components Created
- Canvas component with device-specific rendering
- ImageUploader with drag-and-drop support
- ControlPalette with dynamic button loading
- Layout with responsive navigation
- Editor page with integrated components

### ✅ Advanced Features Implemented
- Drag-and-drop control placement and repositioning
- 8-point resize handles for controls
- Control deletion (Delete key + X button)
- JSON preview with live updates
- Grid snapping system with visual overlay
- Custom button creator modal
- Control properties panel (position/size/extended edges)
- Two-column desktop layout
- Bottom-sliding properties panel
- Project save/load with localStorage
- Export to .deltaskin functionality
- Comprehensive ID system for all elements

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Complete Image Persistence
- Store uploaded images in IndexedDB
- Restore images when loading projects
- Handle large file storage efficiently
- Add image caching for performance

### 2. Enhanced Export Functionality
- Validate skin data before export
- Add export format options (.deltaskin/.gammaskin)
- Include metadata in exports
- Generate preview thumbnails

### 3. Import Existing Skins
- Parse .deltaskin file structure
- Load existing control mappings
- Import background images
- Handle version compatibility

### 4. Landscape Orientation Support
- Add orientation toggle
- Separate control mappings for portrait/landscape
- Responsive canvas sizing
- Maintain control positions across orientations

### 5. Advanced Features
- Undo/redo functionality with history stack
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+S, etc.)
- Control grouping and alignment tools
- Copy/paste controls
- Snap to other controls (not just grid)

## Development Workflow
1. Focus on completing persistence features
2. Ensure all data survives page refresh
3. Test export/import cycle thoroughly
4. Add comprehensive error handling

## Testing Strategy
- Test localStorage limits and fallbacks
- Verify export files work in actual emulators
- Test with various image sizes and formats
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Current Sprint Goals
1. ✅ Grid snapping and visual feedback
2. ✅ Custom button creation
3. ✅ Properties panel for fine control
4. ✅ Project management UI
5. ⏳ Complete persistence layer
6. ⏳ Polish export functionality

## Next Session Focus
1. Implement IndexedDB for image storage
2. Complete auto-save functionality
3. Add import feature for existing skins
4. Create landscape orientation support
5. Begin undo/redo implementation
