## Data Flow

### Input Flow
1. User selects console system → Loads available buttons
2. User selects iPhone model → Sets canvas dimensions
3. User uploads image → Validates against device dimensions
4. User places controls → Updates internal state

### Output Flow
1. Control placement → JSON generation
2. JSON + Images → ZIP packaging
3. ZIP → Renamed to .deltaskin/.gammaskin
4. Final file → Download to user device
