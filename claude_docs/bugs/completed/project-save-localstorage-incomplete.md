# Project Save to localStorage Incomplete - FIXED

## Issue Description
Saving a project didn't properly save all JSON parameters to localStorage. When loading a saved project, only the game screen displayed and it was positioned incorrectly.

## Symptoms
- Project save appeared to complete successfully
- On reload/load, only game screen element showed
- Game screen was not positioned correctly
- Other control elements (buttons, d-pad, etc.) were missing
- JSON parameters not fully persisted to localStorage

## Root Cause
**Race condition in project loading logic** - When a project was saved, the `currentProject` object got updated with a new `lastModified` timestamp, which triggered the loading `useEffect`. The "timestamp-only update" detection logic was incomplete and didn't account for controls and screens data, causing the loading logic to run and overwrite the current UI state with stale data.

## Technical Details
1. User adds controls and screens to canvas
2. User clicks save button  
3. `handleSave` function saves project data including controls/screens
4. `currentProject` object gets updated with new `lastModified` timestamp
5. This triggers the `useEffect` that depends on `currentProject` (line 172 in Editor.tsx)
6. The timestamp-only update detection (line 186-203) didn't compare controls/screens data
7. Loading logic runs and overwrites UI state, clearing controls and screens

## Fix Applied
Enhanced the timestamp-only update detection in `Editor.tsx` (lines 186-208) to include:

1. **Controls comparison**: Compare current UI controls with stored project controls
2. **Screens comparison**: Compare current UI screens with stored project screens  
3. **Deep comparison**: Use JSON.stringify to compare the actual data, not just counts
4. **Early return**: Skip loading if only timestamp changed and controls/screens match

### Code Changes
```typescript
// Added comprehensive data comparison
const currentOrientationData = getOrientationData(currentOrientation);
const currentControlsMatch = currentOrientationData && 
  currentOrientationData.controls.length === controls.length &&
  JSON.stringify(currentOrientationData.controls) === JSON.stringify(controls);
const currentScreensMatch = currentOrientationData && 
  currentOrientationData.screens.length === screens.length &&
  JSON.stringify(currentOrientationData.screens) === JSON.stringify(screens);

const isJustTimestampUpdate = 
  skinName === currentProject.name && 
  skinIdentifier === currentProject.identifier &&
  selectedConsole === currentProject.console?.shortName &&
  selectedDevice === currentProject.device?.model &&
  !orientationChanged &&
  currentControlsMatch &&        // NEW: Check controls match
  currentScreensMatch &&         // NEW: Check screens match
  (!latestSkinData.current.device || latestSkinData.current.device === currentProject.device?.model);
```

## Testing
- Added comprehensive logging to track save/load operations
- Fixed TypeScript errors (removed undefined `user` variable references)
- Verified fix prevents unnecessary UI state reloading after save operations

## Resolution
âœ… **FIXED** - Controls and screens are now properly preserved after save/load operations. The race condition has been eliminated by improving the timestamp-only update detection logic.

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/Editor.tsx` - Enhanced timestamp-only update detection
- `src/pages/Editor.tsx` - Fixed TypeScript errors
- `src/pages/Editor.tsx` - Added debugging logs for save/load tracking
