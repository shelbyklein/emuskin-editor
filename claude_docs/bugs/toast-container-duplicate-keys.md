# Toast Container Duplicate Keys Warning

## Issue Description
React warning about duplicate keys in ToastContainer component causing potential rendering issues.

## Error Details
```
Warning: Encountered two children with the same key, `1756191233796`. Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates. Non-unique keys may cause children to be duplicated and/or omitted â€” the behavior is unsupported and could change in a future version.
```

## Stack Trace
```

## Context
- Occurs during save operations in the skin editor

2. Upload a skin image
3. Click save button
4. Toast notifications appear with duplicate keys

## Files Involved
