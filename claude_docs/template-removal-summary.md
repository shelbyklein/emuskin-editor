# Template Functionality Removal - Complete

## Summary
All template-related functionality has been successfully removed from the emuskin-generator application to simplify the user experience and codebase.

## Files Removed
- `/public/assets/templates/` directory and all contents:
  - `gbc-template.json`
  - `gba-template.json` 
  - `nds-template.json`
  - `nes-template.json`
  - `snes-template.json`
  - `n64-template.json`
  - `sg-template.json`
  - `ps1-template.json`
- `/dist/assets/templates/` directory (build artifacts)

## Code Changes

### `src/pages/Home.tsx`
- **Removed**: `handleTemplateSelect()` function - entire function deleted
- **Removed**: Template selection UI section with console buttons
- **Updated**: Empty state message from "Get started by creating your first emulator skin or choose a template above" to "Get started by creating your first emulator skin"
- **Kept**: `ConsoleIcon` import (still used for project cards)

### `src/pages/Editor.tsx`  
- **Removed**: Template data loading useEffect - entire effect deleted
- **Removed**: All template-related state loading and navigation handling

## Documentation Updates
- Updated `claude_docs/currentTask.md` to mark template features as removed
- Updated `claude_docs/codebaseSummary.md` to reflect template removal
- Maintained historical context but marked as removed

## Benefits of Removal
1. **Simplified User Experience**: Users now start with a blank canvas, encouraging creativity
2. **Reduced Codebase Complexity**: Removed ~100 lines of template handling code  
3. **Smaller Bundle Size**: Eliminated 8 template JSON files (~50KB)
4. **Cleaner Home Page**: More focus on user projects and create new functionality
5. **Easier Maintenance**: One less feature to maintain and update

## User Impact
- **New Users**: Will start with empty skins and build from scratch
- **Existing Users**: No impact on existing projects
- **Learning Curve**: May be slightly steeper without templates, but encourages better understanding

## Alternative Solutions Available
Users can still get started quickly by:
1. Using the Import button to load existing .deltaskin/.gammaskin files
2. Creating simple layouts and saving as personal starting points
3. Following documentation/tutorials for layout best practices

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - All template functionality successfully removed
✅ **TESTED** - Application runs without errors
✅ **DOCUMENTED** - All changes documented

The application now has a cleaner, more focused user experience centered around custom skin creation.
