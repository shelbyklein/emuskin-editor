## Next Steps
1. Implement undo/redo functionality
   - Track state changes in history stack (max 50 states)
   - Add keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl+Z, Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Z)
   - Visual undo/redo buttons in toolbar
   - Track control/screen add, move, resize, delete actions
   
2. Add keyboard shortcuts

   - Cmd/Ctrl+S: Save current project
   - Cmd/Ctrl+E: Export skin

   - Distribute controls evenly
   - Visual guides when dragging

## Technical Debt
- Consider migrating from localStorage to IndexedDB for all project data
- Add comprehensive error handling for file operations
