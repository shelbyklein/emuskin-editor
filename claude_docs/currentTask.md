2. Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
   - Delete/Backspace: Delete selected control/screen
   - Arrow keys: Nudge selected item by 1px (10px with Shift)
   - Cmd/Ctrl+S: Save current project
   - Cmd/Ctrl+E: Export skin
   - Escape: Deselect current item
   
3. Add success/error toasts
   - Replace alert() calls with toast notifications
   - Better UX for save/export/import operations
   - Non-blocking user feedback
   
4. Control alignment tools (future)
   - Align selected controls (left, right, center, top, bottom)
   - Distribute controls evenly
   - Visual guides when dragging

## Technical Debt
- Consider migrating from localStorage to IndexedDB for all project data
- Add comprehensive error handling for file operations
