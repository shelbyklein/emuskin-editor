# Fix for Vercel Deployment Crash

## What Was Wrong
The API was crashing because:
1. MongoDB connection was failing due to missing environment variables
2. The code called `process.exit(1)` on connection failure, which crashes serverless functions
3. Vercel serverless functions need special handling for database connections

## What I Fixed
1. Created Vercel-specific database handler that:
   - Caches connections between function invocations
   - Doesn't crash the process on connection failure
   - Returns proper error messages instead

2. Updated the app to:
   - Check database connection per request (except health endpoint)
   - Return 503 error if database is unavailable
   - Keep health endpoint working even without database

## Next Steps

### 1. Deploy the Fixed API
```bash
cd api
git pull  # Get the latest fixes
vercel --prod --yes
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables on Vercel
Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard and select your `emuskin-api` project:

**Required Variables:**
- `MONGODB_URI`: Your DigitalOcean MongoDB connection string
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: `https://emuskin.vercel.app,http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:8008`
- `NODE_ENV`: `production`

### 3. Test the Deployment
```bash
# Health check (should work even without database)
curl https://emuskin-api.vercel.app/health

# Should return something like:
# {
#   "status": "ok",
#   "timestamp": "2025-01-20T...",
#   "environment": "production",
#   "hasMongoUri": false  # Will be true once env var is set
# }
```

### 4. Once Environment Variables Are Set
The API will automatically start working with the database. You can verify by checking:
- `hasMongoUri` should be `true` in health response
- Login should work on the frontend
- Projects should sync between devices

## If You Still See Crashes
Check the Vercel function logs:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Select your API project
3. Go to Functions tab
4. Click on logs to see detailed error messages
